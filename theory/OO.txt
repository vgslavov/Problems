interface:
- declares a set of related methods
- defines an API
- in C++: a class w/o data members and only pure virtual f.
- implement an interface by deriving from the class
- invoke conceptually related functionality

abstract class:
- declares but does not define all its methods
- proper class
- behavior left to be defined by subclasses
- can’t instantiate, only instances of concrete subclasses can be
- in C++: no constructor?
- in C++: any class which contains a pure virtual f. or inherits one w/o redefining it?
- implement “is-a” relationship

polymorphism:

virtual functions:
- override (redefine, not overload!) methods defined by ancestors
- method definition determined at run time based on actual type/class of obj. on which it is invoked
  non-virtual determined at compile time based on type of ref./ptr.
- used for polymorphism
- a single method call invokes different method definitions based on the class of the obj.
- pure virtual: a method declared but explicitly not defined
- overhead

inheritance:

--[ cplusplus.com

a pointer to a derived class is type-compatible with a pointer to its base class:

Base *b = new Derived();

non-virtual members of derived classes cannot be accessed through a reference of the base class

what the virtual keyword does is to allow a member of a derived class with the same name as
one in the base class to be appropriately called from a pointer
and more precisely when the type of the pointer is a pointer to
the base class that is pointing to an object of the derived class

Base *b = new Derived();

A class that declares or inherits a virtual function is called a polymorphic class.

Classes that contain at least one pure virtual function are known as abstract base classes

Abstract base classes cannot be used to instantiate objects. It can be used to create pointers to it

objects of different but related types are referred to using a unique type of pointer (Polygon*)
and the proper member function is called every time, just because they are virtual

—-[ Quant Job Interview Questions & Answers

polymorphism:
- means "many shapes"
- describes the process of having a base class with virtual f.
  defined in inherited classes
- client code can treat an obj as a base class obj but its behaviour can vary
  according to which inherited class it is from

abstract class:
- contains a pure virtual method (virtual & ends with =0)
- inherited from a pure virtual class & doesn't override the pure virtual f.
- cannot be instantiated
- can only be used through an inherited class which is concrete
- pure virtual method need not be defined (but can be)

virtual f:
- allow to defer the implementation of a f. declared in a base class
  to an inherited class
- the virtual f. for the right object type is called automatically
- virtual keyword in inherited classes is optional
- overriding f. in CallOption and PutOption has different implementations
- user of Option object doesn't know which payoff() is called,
  the virtual f. of right one is called

example:
class VanillaOption {
    virtual void payoff();
};

class CallOption: public Option {
    void payoff() { cout << "CallOption called"; }
};

class PutOption: public Option {
    void payoff() { cout << "PutOption called"; }
};

VanillaOption *vopt = new CallOption();
vopt.payoff();  // prints "CallOption called"

virtual dtors:
- when deleting an inherited class obj (allocated dynamically)
  via a ptr to a base class obj, the correct dtor needs to be called
  (the inherited class dtor, not the base class one!)
- always declare dtors virtual if any method is pure abstract
  (not defined in the base class) or even if it is only virtual

a class containing virtual f. should always have a virtual dtor. that means all
inherited classes which have f. which override that base-class virtual f. (the
inherited-class functions are virtual) should have virtual dtors too?

order of ctor and dtor calls:
- the more fundamental something is, the sooner it is constructed
  and the later it is destructed
- an inherited class may need to use the base class during either ctor or dtor,
  but the converse is never true

example:
class A {};
class B: public A
{
    C data;
};
class C {};

call order:
- ctors: A, C, B
- dtors: B, C, A

ctor/dtor rules:
- the most primitive first for construction and last for destruction
- a base class is more primitive than a class inherited from it,
  and data members are more primitive than the class they are members of
- the bases of a class are more primitive than its data members

provided by compiler (trivial impl.):
1. copy ctor (calls copy ctor of each data member making a shallow copy)
2. assign. op. (calls assign. op of each data member
3. dtor
- shallow copy OK if POD, but not if ptrs
- use smart ptrs to avoid having to declare the above 3
- non-trivial dtor needed if new op. was used
- dtor should be virtual if obj is likely to be deleted via ptr to base class

“rule of three”:
if a class has one of:
- a destructor,
- a copy constructor,
- an assignment operator
it generally needs all three

“rule of almost zero”:
a class should have none of the three,
except an empty virtual destructor when it has abstract methods
(and use smart pointers to take care of memory allocation/deallocation)

virtual f. impl:
- virtual f. table stores ptrs to all declared virtual f.
- one copy of table for each class
- each class obj with virtual f. contains a ptr to the table for that class
- obj which contain virtual f. are larger because of the table

virtual f. disadv:
- extra instructions needed because called using ptr indirection
  (processor jumps to a location contained in a ptr rather than
  a pre-determined one)
- virtual f. cannot be inlined (no opt. based on content)
- objs are larger which can be a problem if many objs
- mem locality: virtual f. for different classes can be in diff. parts of mem

correct pairing:
- new & delete (a single obj)
- new[] & delete[] (an array of objs)

throwing in ctors:
- yes!
- but dtor will never be called! (obj. never constructed)
- however, the dtors of all fully-constructed data members will be called
- if in {} (main part of ctor), all data members are already full-constructed
- no return value, therefore throwing is only (almost) option
- use smart ptrs to ensure allocated mem./resources is/are freed

throwing in dtors:
- never!
- because C++ standard says program terminates if 2 unhandled exceptions happen simult.
- when dtors throw, that is very likely to happen (chain reaction of other dtors throwing)

copying polymorphic objs:
- use a 'virtual' ctor
- actually, use a virtual method which calls the ctor
- inherited class knows its own type (can copy itself)
- return type is ptr to *inherited* class obj allocated on the heap
- changing return types is allowed when overriding in inherited class

virtual Base* clone() const = 0;

virtual Inherited* clone() const
{
    return new Inherited(*this);
}

user-defined assign. operator in inherited class if user-defined in base class:
- no need to redefine
- uses compiler-generated one (which will call assign. op. for each base class)
- changing impl. of base class should not affect recoding of inherited class
