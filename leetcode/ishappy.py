# A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
# * Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the
#   squares of its digits.
# * Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it
#   loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
# * Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

# 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
